        <p>Fettering is a practice used to contact human spirits. Since it requires some preparation, here's a guide written by us in cooperation with the spirit of Aunt Marilissa.</p>

        <p><h1 style="color: red;">WARNING</h1>Despite being the most reliable method of communicating with spirits, fettering can also be a very taxxing process for them, as it involves dragging them closer to our own layer of reality. You should ALWAYS get the spirit's consent through other means of interlayer communication before starting a fettering session.</p>

                <h4>
                    Necessary Material
                </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        One digital device with a screen and speakers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Four lit red candles
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Four chains which can hold the digital device in place
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Chalk
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A timer, set to 120 seconds (2 minutes)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Salt
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                    Steps
                </h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Draw the Connection Circle with chalk:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Energy Sources should be drawn on four extremes of the circle 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Receptacle should be drawn in the exact middle
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Database should be written around the circle in the following order: Spirit's current layer (Dead people's spirits are always on layer Tribus), Spirit's original name, Spirit's aqquired name, Resolution (Avoid going over VII)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place each of the four candles on the Energy Sources
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place the digital device on the Receptacle
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wrap the chains around each of the candles, four turns each, then around the digital device, four turns each. (Do not stretch the chains, live them in a zig-zag path)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Draw a circle of salt around the connection circle, making sure to leave no gaps.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Light the candles
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the chains start going up the candles, towards the flame, and tightening around the digital device. The connection has been succesfully stablished.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After some minutes the digital device should light up. The screen should show the face of your chosen spirit as you remember it.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If you don't remember the face shown, or it seems in any way off. Turn the candles off immediately. The connection has been hijacked by a non-human spirit.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Clean up after yourself as best as you can and do not repeat the process near this same location.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Start the timer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You may speak as you would with the spirit for as long as the timer is running.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the timer runs out, quickly turn off the candles. This should break the connection and allow the spirit to return to their own layer.
                        <ul>
                            <li>It's important to respect the timer, as suspending the spirit in a liminal layer for too long may leave them trapped. 2 minutes is a safe time limit</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Clean up after yourself and be sure to only repeat this process after 24 hours or more have passed.
                    </li>
